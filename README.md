GUI: “GUI_AnalytesFields_Tab.png” & “GUI_Instrumentation_Tab.png”

Sample Raw Data:

“GROB Z-Test EG1@1600_60.csv” This *.csv file contains the processed data exported from the software interfaced to our Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer.  Within this file is every chemical the instrument found within a single sample along with each user defined metric.  Every sample measurement would generate a single *.csv file.  For a single experiment it was not uncommon to generate hundreds of *.csv files.
